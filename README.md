## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Protocol Support**:  
  - TCP: Reliable, connection-oriented communication.  
  - UDP: Fast, connectionless communication.  
- **Data Encryption**:  
  - AES encryption to secure transmitted data.  
- **Error Detection**:  
  - Checksum-based validation to ensure data integrity.  
- **Multi-Language Integration**:  
  - C++ for the sender, Rust for the receiver.  
- **Simulation-Driven Testing**:  
  - Supports integration with simulation tools like X-Plane or Unreal Engine.
